# ProWRAS
A multi-schematic classifier independent oversampling approach
- In this repository we provide a preliminary implementation of the ProWRAS algorithm
- We compare ProWRAS with some state-of-the-art oversampling approache
- The code can be found in COSPOV/ProWRAS/model_notebook.ipynb
- Datasets can be imported from two sources
  -The datasets from imblearn library can be imported directly
  -We provide .pickle files for some other datasets in COSPOV/ProWRAS/ which can be imported in the notebook
